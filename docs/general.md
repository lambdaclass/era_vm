# General documentation

## Heaps/Aux Heaps and Fat Pointers.

How we manage them through page ids, when regular heaps are used and when aux heaps are used. Explain what a FatPointer is, what narrowing is.

## Far Calls vs Near Calls. CallFrames and Context

Far Calls are the equivalent of calls in the EVM, they are used to call external contracts. Near Calls are used to call internal functions within the same contract that is being executed.

Contracts have their own unique `Context` which itself can hold multiple `CallFrame`s. `CallFrame`s are used to keep track of the current state of the contract being executed.

#### When a Far Call is made, a new `Context` is created and pushed into the running `Context`s of the vm. `Context`s are composed of:

- Contract `Address`
- Caller `Address`
- Code `Address`
- Code Page
- `Stack`
- Running `CallFrame`s (created by Near Calls)
- `Heap`
- `AuxHeap`
- `CalldataHeap`

The amount of gas that can be allocated to a new `Context` is limited to 64/64 of the currently available gas in the running `Context`.

**A new Near Call will inherit the properties of the current `CallFrame`, and make use of the `Stack` and `Heap`s of the running `Context`**.

#### `CallFrame`s are composed of:

- Available gas
- Exemption handler
- Stack Pointer
- Program Counter

### Far Call wrapping

Let's look at the following solidity code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract LibraryContract {
    function someFunction() public {}
}

contract CallerContract {
    LibraryContract libraryContract;

    constructor(address _libraryContractAddress) {
        libraryContract = LibraryContract(_libraryContractAddress);
    }

    function callNonReturningFunction() public {
        libraryContract.someFunction();
    }
}
```

Here we are calling a function of an external contract, this should net us a `far_call` instruction on our compiled code.

Compiling this code with `zksolc` gives us (part of) the following assembly:

```assembly
.text
	.file	"test.sol:CallerContract"
	.globl	__entry
__entry:
.func_begin0:
	nop	 stack+=[1 + r0]
	add	 r1, r0, r3
	shr.s	96, r3, r3
   ...
	near_call	r0, @__farcall, @DEFAULT_UNWIND
   ...
.func_end0:

__farcall:
.func_begin2:
.tmp0:
	far_call	r1, r2, @.BB2_2
.tmp1:
	add	 1, r0, r2
	ret
.BB2_2:
.tmp2:
	add	 r0, r0, r2
	ret
.func_end2:
...
```

Notice how instead of calling `far_call` directly, we are calling `near_call` which in turn calls `far_call`. This is because `far_call` does not return a value, so we need to wrap it in a `near_call` to return a boolean indicating success wheter the call was successful (1) or not (0).

### Data passing between contracts

To send and receive (read only) data between contracts, we make use of Fat Pointers, these are the second type of value that the VM can handle, this type is composed of four 32bit values:

- bits `0..31`: offset
- bits `32..63`: internal memory page ID
- bits `64…95`: starting address of the fragment
- bits `96…127`: length of the fragment

When choosing how to pass data to a contract (whether when calling or returning from a call) we have a choice:

- pass an existing fat pointer
- create a new fat pointer from a fragment of heap/auxheap.

This is handled by the `get_forward_memory_pointer` function TODO

A Fat Pointer will delimit a fragment accessible to other contract, accesses outside this fragment through a pointer yield zero. They also provide an offset inside this fragment which can be increased or decreased.

## Call Types

Regular, Mimic, and Delegate. Explain the differences between them and how MimicCalls are used to call constructors on behalf of the deployed contract.

## Precompiles and System calls

Explain how calls to precompiles work, use keccak as an example as it's used on every deployment (it goes to the `keccak.yul` contract which then uses the `precompile` opcode).
What are system contracts? What's a system call? Show some examples (deployer, nonce holder, L2BaseToken) and what they're used for.

## `context.get_context_u128` opcode, msg.value, payable functions

Explain what `msg.value` is in solidity, how that maps to `context.get_context_u128` and a small example showing how non-payable functions revert when `context.get_context_u128` is not set to zero on calls.

Show an example of the assembly generated by a function doing a `call` sending money and how it ends up calling the `MsgValueSimulator` (address `0x8009`, `32777` in decimal) which in turn calls the `L2BaseToken` contract. Something like this:

```
function sendMoney(address payable to) public payable {
  (bool success, bytes memory _data) = to.call{value: msg.value}("");
  require(success, "Failed to send Ether");
}
```

## Tracers and how to add prints

How tracer works, how the PrintTracer works, how to add prints when running contracts.

## Difference between a revert and a panic; exception handlers

Talk about what a revert and a panic are; what specifically can trigger a panic inside the VM. What's an exception handler? How are they managed on `CallFrame`s? Show some assembly example.

## Bootloader

TODO
Operator execution (transactions come in, get executed on the bootloader, state is suspended until new transaction shows up).
