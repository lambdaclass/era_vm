# General documentation

## Heaps/Aux Heaps and Fat Pointers.

How we manage them through page ids, when regular heaps are used and when aux heaps are used. Explain what a FatPointer is, what narrowing is.

## Far Calls vs Near Calls. CallFrames and Context

Explain the difference between the two, what information `CallFrame`s and `Context`s hold. Why `zksolc` wraps every far call in a near call to return the `success` boolean (with example assembly).

How far calls pass calldata and returndata between contracts through pointers. Explain the `get_memory_forward_pointer` function and its variants.

## Call Types

Regular, Mimic, and Delegate. Explain the differences between them and how MimicCalls are used to call constructors on behalf of the deployed contract.

## Precompiles and System calls

Explain how calls to precompiles work, use keccak as an example as it's used on every deployment (it goes to the `keccak.yul` contract which then uses the `precompile` opcode).
What are system contracts? What's a system call? Show some examples (deployer, nonce holder, L2BaseToken) and what they're used for.

## `context.get_context_u128` opcode, msg.value, payable functions

Explain what `msg.value` is in solidity, how that maps to `context.get_context_u128` and a small example showing how non-payable functions revert when `context.get_context_u128` is not set to zero on calls.

Show an example of the assembly generated by a function doing a `call` sending money and how it ends up calling the `MsgValueSimulator` (address `0x8009`, `32777` in decimal) which in turn calls the `L2BaseToken` contract. Something like this:

```
function sendMoney(address payable to) public payable {
  (bool success, bytes memory _data) = to.call{value: msg.value}("");
  require(success, "Failed to send Ether");
}
```

## Tracers and how to add prints

A `Tracer` should comply with the following trait
```
pub trait Tracer {
    fn before_execution(&mut self, _opcode: &Opcode, _vm: &mut VMState) -> Result<(), EraVmError>;
}
```

The `before_execution` function will be called on every loop just before the opcode execution.
Right now that is the only function the trait has, in the future more may be added as needed, like `before_decoding`, `after_decoding` or `after_execution`

An important Tracer is what we call the `PrintTracer`, with it we can print stuff on solidity contracts.

Here is an example of a contract with prints
```
pragma solidity >=0.4.16;

contract WithPrints {

    // This is for strings	
    function printIt(bytes32 toPrint) public {
        assembly {
            function $llvm_NoInline_llvm$_printString(__value) {
                let DEBUG_SLOT_OFFSET := mul(32, 32)
                    mstore(add(DEBUG_SLOT_OFFSET, 0x20), 0x00debdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdf)
                    mstore(add(DEBUG_SLOT_OFFSET, 0x40), __value)
                    mstore(DEBUG_SLOT_OFFSET, 0x4A15830341869CAA1E99840C97043A1EA15D2444DA366EFFF5C43B4BEF299681)
        }
            $llvm_NoInline_llvm$_printString(toPrint)
        }
    }
    // This is for numbers
   function printItNum(uint256 toPrint) public {
        assembly {
            function $llvm_NoInline_llvm$_printString(__value) {
                let DEBUG_SLOT_OFFSET := mul(32, 32)
                    mstore(add(DEBUG_SLOT_OFFSET, 0x20), 0x00debdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebdebde)
                    mstore(add(DEBUG_SLOT_OFFSET, 0x40), __value)
                    mstore(DEBUG_SLOT_OFFSET, 0x4A15830341869CAA1E99840C97043A1EA15D2444DA366EFFF5C43B4BEF299681)
        }
            $llvm_NoInline_llvm$_printString(toPrint)
        }
    }

    function aFunction() public returns(uint64) {
        uint64 result = 42;
        printIt("RESULT");
        printItNum(result);
        return result;
    }
}
```

There are two types of prints, strings and numbers, for that we have printIt and printItNum respectively.
What these functions are doing is, they use a debug slot defined as 1024, on `debug_slot + 32` we store a value that indicates if the print is going to be a string or a number, then on `debug_slot + 64` we store the value itself, and on `debug_slot` we store a magic value.

Here is where the PrintTracer does its magic, before every execution it looks if the opcode executed is a `HeapWrite`, this is the opcode responsible for storing things in the Heap, which is in the end what we are doing with the `mstore`, if the value being written is the magic value and its being written on the debug slot, then we know we are in one of the print functions and we need to print the value.

So we get from the heap the values on `debug_slot + 32` and `debug_slot + 64`, with the first one we check if we have to print a string or a number, and we print the correspondent one.

Have in mind that currently, mainly because of compiler optimizations, some prints may not appear, specially if they are right after each other.

In order to perform prints, at the moment we need to change the following on `src/lib.rs`

```
fn run_opcodes(vm: VMState, storage: &mut dyn Storage) -> (ExecutionOutput, VMState) {
    run(vm.clone(), storage, &mut []).unwrap_or((ExecutionOutput::Panic, vm))
}
```

For

```
use tracers::print_tracer::PrintTracer;

...

fn run_opcodes(vm: VMState, storage: &mut dyn Storage) -> (ExecutionOutput, VMState) {
    let mut tracer = PrintTracer {};
    run(vm.clone(), storage, &mut [Box::new(&mut tracer)]).unwrap_or((ExecutionOutput::Panic, vm))
}
```
## Difference between a revert and a panic; exception handlers

Talk about what a revert and a panic are; what specifically can trigger a panic inside the VM. What's an exception handler? How are they managed on `CallFrame`s? Show some assembly example.

## Bootloader

TODO
Operator execution (transactions come in, get executed on the bootloader, state is suspended until new transaction shows up).
